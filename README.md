Virtual Mouse is a simple Python program that allows users to control their computer's mouse cursor with hand gestures captured by a webcam. It is an alternative input device for people with limited mobility or for situations where using a traditional mouse is not possible.

## Features

- Allows users to control the mouse cursor with hand gestures
- Supports left and right clicks
- User-friendly interface that is easy to set up and use

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8
- OpenCV
- PyAutoGUI

## Installation

To run the program, you will need to install the following Python packages:

pip install opencv-python
pip install pyautogui

You will also need a webcam connected to your computer.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `virtual-mouse` directory.
3. Run the `virtual_mouse.py` file in a Python environment.
4. Calibrate the program by placing your hand in the green box and adjusting the sliders until your hand is properly tracked.
5. Move your hand in front of the webcam to control the mouse cursor. Make a fist to perform a left-click and raise your index finger to perform a right-click.
